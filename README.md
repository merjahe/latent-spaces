# latent-spaces
This is the github repo from which we can all collaborate!

# benchmark datasets
Which benchmark data will we use [TODO: link to said datasets]

# pre-processing 
What are best practices for pre-processing each dataset? Why? [TODO: someone fill this out]

# tools
Which tools are each group member planning on using? [TODO: a table of PI, tool name, link to code, link to paper]

# standardized file formats
[TODO: ask Elana how to frame and get this started]
  * Input file format (gene-cell expression values, metadata, uncertainty estimates)
  * Output file formats (representation of latent spaces, which aspects are shared?, which aspects are method specific?)

# benchmarks
What are the planned tests and comparisons between methods?
